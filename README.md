👋 Hey there, I'm Zachary Corvidae, but you might know me better as the sneaky crow 🐦. With over two decades of experience in the world of application development, I've been deeply immersed in the ever-evolving landscape of technology, constantly refining my skills and adapting to new challenges.

Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of contributing to a diverse range of projects and companies, from industry giants to boutique agencies. I've even taken the leap into entrepreneurship, founding multiple successful ventures along the way.

But it's not all about coding for me. I find inspiration and solace in a variety of hobbies and interests. Whether I'm crafting melodies, diving into immersive virtual worlds 🎮, exploring the depths of literature 📚, or simply soaking in the stunning beauty of the Pacific Northwest 🌲, I'm always on the lookout for new avenues of creativity and enrichment.

If you're passionate about innovation and collaboration like I am, I'm always open to new opportunities and partnerships. Feel free to shoot me an email to start a conversation, or check out my resume to learn more about my professional journey. Let's connect and create something awesome together! 🚀
